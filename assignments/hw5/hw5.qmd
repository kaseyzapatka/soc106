## Question 1: Free Throw Probability

**Lisa makes free throws 75% of the time, and shoots eight free throws at the end of practice.**

**a) In words, describe what you would need to calculate to find the probability that Lisa makes at least seven free throws. What are the values of n and π, and which outcomes do you need to add up?**

*Your answer here:*

**b) In R: what is the probability that she will make between four and six free throws?**

## Question 2: Exam Performance

**Javier takes a 50 question exam. In practice exams, he has answered each question correctly 80% of the time, and his likelihood of answering one question correctly is independent of whether he answers any other question correctly.**

**a) What is the mean number of questions he will get correct on the exam? What is the standard deviation of the number of questions he will get correct?**

*Show your work here:*

```{r}

# Your code here

```

*Your answer here:*

**b) A student needs to get 70% of questions correct to pass the exam. What is the probability that he will pass the exam? (use R to answer)**

```{r}

# Your code here

```

## Question 3: Height and Z-scores

**Andre is selected from a population where height is distributed normally with mean 69 inches and standard deviation 3 inches. The individual is measured with a height of 75 inches.**

**a) Calculate the z-score of Andre's height.**

*Show your work here:*

```{r}

# Your code here

```

*Your answer here:*

**b) Just from the z-score, can you tell whether Andre's height is above the 95th percentile of height? Why or why not? How about the 97th percentile of height? Why or why not?**

*Your answer here:*

## Question 4: Vehicle Speeds on I-5

**Assume the speed of vehicles along a stretch of I-5 has an approximately normal distribution with a mean of 71 mph and a standard deviation of 8 mph.**

**a) The current speed limit is 65 mph. What is the proportion of vehicles less than or equal to the speed limit?**

```{r}

# Your code here


```

*Your answer here:*

**b) What proportion of the vehicles would be going less than or equal to 50 mph?**

```{r}

# Your code here

```

*Your answer here:*

**c) A new speed limit will be initiated such that approximately 10% of vehicles will be over the speed limit. What is the new speed limit based on this criterion?**

```{r}

# Your code here

```

## Question 5: NCAA SAT Requirements

**The NCAA requires Division I athletes to score over 820 on the combined math and verbal SAT exam to compete in their first college year. The SAT scores of 2003 were approximately normal with mean 1026 and standard deviation 209.**

**a) What proportion of all students would be NCAA qualifiers (SAT \> 820)?**

```{r}

# Your code here

```

*Your answer here:*

**b) The NCAA defines a "partial qualifier" eligible to practice and receive an athletic scholarship, but not to compete, as a combined SAT score over 720 but less than or equal to 820. What proportion of all students who take the SAT would be partial qualifiers?**

```{r}

# Your code here
