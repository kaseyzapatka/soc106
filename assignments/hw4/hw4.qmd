## Question 1: Tossing Three Coins

**I toss a fair coin three times, which land heads or tails with equal probability.**

**a) What is the sample space S of possible outcomes?**

*Your answer here (you can list all outcomes or use R to generate them):*

**b) What is probability that I get two out of three heads? Three out of three heads? At least one head? (hint: remember that P(at least one head) = 1 – P(no heads)!)**

*Your answers:*

-   P(two heads) =
-   P(three heads) =
-   P(at least one head) =

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 2: Drawing from a Deck of Playing Cards

I draw one card from a deck of playing cards with 52 cards. What is the probability that I selected a club or a face card (jack, queen, or king)? (Hint: use the addition rule!)

*Your answer:*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 3: Cal Football Conditional Probability

The Cal football team has beat Stanford and won their bowl game in 40% of their seasons. If they beat Stanford in 67% (2/3rds) of their seasons, then what is the probability that they will win a bowl game, given that they beat Stanford in a season?

*Your answer:*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 4: High Blood Sugar Blood Test

Refer to the following figure showing blood test results for High Blood Sugar:

|                     | High Blood Sugar | No High Blood Sugar | Total |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Positive Blood Test | 48               | 1,307               | 1,355 |
| Negative Blood Test | 6                | 3,921               | 3,927 |
| Total               | 54               | 5,228               | 5,282 |

**a) What is the probability that an individual in this sample does not have High Blood Sugar, given that they have a negative blood test for High Blood Sugar?**

*Your answer:*

**b) What is the probability that an individual in this sample does have High Blood Sugar, given that they have a positive blood test for High Blood Sugar?**

*Your answer:*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 5: Urn with Replacement

*I have an urn that contains 7 red marbles and 3 blue marbles. I choose one marble without looking into the urn (i.e., randomly), put it back, and then choose another marble randomly.*

**a) What is the sample space S of possible outcomes for the first marble and the second marble?**

*Your answer here:*

**b) What is the probability associated with each possible outcome you describe in Part A? (Hint: are the two draws independent from one another?)**

*Your answer:*

-   P(RR) =
-   P(RB) =
-   P(BR) =
-   P(BB) =

**c) Using part b), what is the probability that I drew no red marbles? One red marble? Two red marbles?**

*Your answers:*

-   P(no red marbles) =
-   P(one red marble) =
-   P(two red marbles) =

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 6: Urn without Replacement

**After a while, I decide to return to the urn, which still contains 7 red marbles and 3 blue marbles. This time, I take one marble without looking into the urn (i.e., randomly), note its color, and then, without putting it back, take another marble without looking into the urn.**

**a) The sample space is the same as in the previous question—but now, what is the probability associated with each outcome? (Hint: are the two draws independent from one another?)**

*Your answer:*

-   P(RR) =
-   P(RB) =
-   P(BR) =
-   P(BB) =

**b) Using part a), what is the probability that I drew no red marbles? One red marble? Two red marbles?**

*Your answers:*

-   P(no red marbles) =
-   P(one red marble) =
-   P(two red marbles) =
