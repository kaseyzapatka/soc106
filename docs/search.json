    "text": "Course description and objectives\nSociology 1061 is an intermediate undergraduate sociology research methods course. It will emphasize the motivation, computation, and interpretation of statistical tests for one or two continuous or categorical variables and give students familarity with basic regression analysis. The course will also train students in the use of the R statistical programming language for data management and analysis.\nSociology 106 is most appropriate for social science undergraduates who have some familiarity with sociological research methods and wish to learn how to carry out a quantitative sociological research project.\nFor most weeks, we will have assigned readings and sometimes videos. You should read the assigned readings or watch the assigned videos BEFORE you come to class. Classroom time will usually be split between a lecture component and a ‘lab’ component. During the first hour of class, I will introduce the relevant statistical techniques and research concepts for the week in a lecture. Then, in the second hour of class, we will learn how to implement these statistical techniques in the programming language R and apply these techniques to actual data.\nBy the end of the semester, students should be able to:\n\nUnderstand the logic of statistical inference\nIdentify appropriate statistical tests for different types of data\nVisualize data and produce descriptive statistics and simple statistical tests using R\nInterpret and communicate statistical results and discuss their relevance in the context of a particular research question."

    "text": "Course requirements\n\nAttendance and participation (10%)\nAttendance and active participation in lecture is essential to learn the concepts of the course, as well as how to implement the R commands, data management skills, and workflow strategies you will need to complete the weekly assignments and research paper. Attendance is especially important because this class meets only once per week.\nYour grade in this category will be determined by your engagement during both lecture and the data analysis components of class. Phones may not be used during class, and you may use your computer only for course-related purposes. This policy is to support your learning and the learning of other students in the class, and violations of this policy will negatively affect your participation grade.\nIn addition, your overall grade may be negatively affected by unexcused absences. If you have more than one unexcused absence from lecture, your highest possible grade will be an A-; if you have more than two unexcused absences from lecture, your highest possible grade will be a B+; etc. If you have more than four unexcused absences from lecture, you will receive a failing grade for the course. If an unforeseen emergency arises that causes you to miss lecture, you should let me know as soon as possible the nature of the emergency and prepare to provide some sort of documentation so that the absence can be excused. If documentation is difficult to obtain, please consult with me.\n\n\nWeekly assignments (30%)\nWeekly assignments may include a short problem set designed to test your comprehension of the concepts from lecture, or require that you address a research question of your choice by using R to analyze data of your choice using one of the techniques we discussed in the previous lecture. Most weeks there will be a bit of both. You will be provided a .qmd file on bCourses to use as a template to complete the assignment. It is highly recommended that you spend some time during the first week of the semester to choose a single dataset that interests you that you will use throughout the semester for your assignments and to use for your final paper (see below for where to find data).\nI encourage you to find data for and work on these assignments with other students. If you do so, you must report who you worked with on the assignment and still must write up your own work in your own words and submit your own R code and output. All students need practice writing up their analysis of data. Copying is plagiarism and will be treated as such (see UC Berkeley’s Academic Code of Conduct).\nWeekly assignments will be posted on bCourses. Assignments will be graded on the following ordinal scale:\n\n0 = not turned in\n1 = below expectations\n2 = meets expectations\n\nAssignments are due on bCourses at 11:59 PM on Thursdays; this timing is so that I can review the assignments and provide feedback to you before class the following Tuesday. There will be 11 weekly assignments over the course of the semester. I will drop your lowest weekly assignment score when calculating your grades on weekly assignments. Each assignment is thus worth 3% of your total grade (3%*10 = 30%).\n\n\nResearch paper (40%)\nEach student will develop and present a research question of their choice, address it by using the descriptive and inferential techniques presented in the course to analyze data in R, and write a paper summarizing your findings. You may use your weekly data analysis assignments to work on your research question. You may also (if permitted by the other instructor) integrate this assignment directly into a paper you are writing in another class; please provide me with documentation of permission from your other instructor if you wish to do so. If you do not have an idea about a possible research question to pursue, please sign up for my office hours in the first few weeks and I can try to help you find a question you are interested in.\nThere will be several milestones throughout the semester to help you smoothly progress towards a final paper. I will give you feedback at each step of the way. Your overall grade on the research paper will be the sum of your grades on the following assignments:\n\nPaper proposal (5%): A (no more than) two-page double spaced proposal for the final paper will be due on bCourses by Thursday, February 26 at 11:59 PM. The proposal should succinctly state the research question, why we might care about the answer to this question, hypotheses about what you think the answer is to the research question (and why), the data source you will use to answer this question, and the key independent and dependent variables in the data. At this point, you do not need to discuss what statistical techniques you will use to answer your research question.\nAnnotated bibliography (5%): Next, you will identify ten scholarly sources related to your research question. Articles in academic journals, books, and book chapters from edited volumes are all considered to be scholarly sources. Blogs, internet and newspaper articles, Wikipedia pages, etc., are NOT considered to be scholarly sources. After identifying these ten scholarly sources, for each source, you will briefly (one to two paragraphs) describe how this source relates to your research question. This includes, but is not limited to, the overall argument in the article or book, the types of evidence the author(s) use to support their article, and any possible weaknesses or strengths in the paper. This annotated bibliography will be due on bCourses by Thursday, March 19 at 11:59 PM.\nIn-class presentation (5%): Then, during our class on April 28, you will give a brief presentation (7-10 minutes) to the class on your research paper. By this point, you should have conducted the statistical analyses you have proposed to answer your research question. Thus, in your presentation, you should discuss the research question, motivation for the research question, hypotheses, data, variables, analyses, and the results of your analyses. This is a great opportunity to get feedback on your (mostly-completed) research project from other members of the class as well as from me.\nFinal paper (20%): Your final research paper will be due on bCourses by Thursday, May 7 at 11:59 PM. This paper should be 10-12 pages double-spaced, not counting a cover page, tables, or references. The paper will roughly follow the same format as your in-class presentation.\n\n\n\nFinal exam (20%)\nThe final exam for our class will be on Monday, May 11 from 11:30 AM to 2:30 PM. The final will be somewhat similar to the weekly homework assignments, except that you will not be asked to analyze data using R. The test will be closed-book and closed-computer, but you will be able to bring a “formula sheet” that contains mathematical formulas, lists of steps typically involved in solving problems, assumptions underlying particular statistical procedures, etc. You may use both sides of one 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper to create your formula sheet. Your formula sheet must be handwritten personally by you, and you must submit your formula sheet with your exam (I will return your sheet after the exam)."

    "text": "Keys to sucess\n\nIn some ways, learning statistics is like learning a language, and it is important not to be intimidated by new terms and concepts. It is often helpful to write in plain language the meaning of the quantities or concepts represented by a letter or symbol.\nPlease ask questions during lecture or during lab if you do not understand. If something is unclear to you, it is probably unclear to other students as well.\nLectures and labs are planned to allow time for questions and answers.\nLecture slides will be made available, but are not a substitute for careful note taking.\nFor most students, learning statistics requires thinking through how to solve problems. Statistics cannot be learned simply by reading a book or listening to a lecture. You should not expect to fully understand the material until after you have completed the relevant assignment.\nBecause most of the material is cumulative, it is essential that you keep up with the course material. If you find yourself falling behind, seek help immediately from me during office hours.\nThe most effective way to study for the exams is to do practice problems. As such, the assignments are a critical part of the course. You are strongly encouraged to do homework assignments and study for exams in groups."

    "text": "Classroom policies\n\nClassroom environment: I intend to help foster a classroom environment where students can seek understanding of the course material free of harassment of any kind. We all come to this class from different backgrounds and with different levels of academic preparation; as such, topics that may seem for some to be ’easy’ to understand are likely not easy for everyone. I ask that you respect other students in the class in all ways and remain cognizant of how your words and actions may come off to others. I will not tolerate racist, sexist, homophobic, or other derogatory comments whatsoever in class.\nOffice hours: I encourage you to come to office hours. Office hours are a good time to introduce yourself, talk about ideas you are thinking about, and ask substantive questions about the course material. Office hours are a great opportunity to start to work on your weekly assignments while being able to ask me for help. I have office hours on Tuesdays before class and right after class (see above). You may sign up for office hours at https://www.wejoinin.com/kaseyzapatka@berkeley.edu or just drop in. I also encourage you to sign up in groups.\nE-mail: E-mail is best for asking logistical questions about the course and should not be used for substantive questions about the course materials or about coding. Please re-read the syllabus before sending a logistical question about the course to ensure that your question is not answered here. If you have a substantive question about the course material (i.e., you are not sure you understand a concept from lecture), please make an appointment to meet me in office hours instead. If you cannot meet during my scheduled office hours, e-mail me and we’ll figure something out. I will endeavor to respond to e-mails received during the week (8 AM Monday-5 PM Friday) within 24 hours, and to e-mails received outside this time by 5 PM Monday.\nAccommodation: I will provide the necessary accommodations to any student who provides me with a letter from a DSP Specialist. Please arrange for me to receive this letter as early in the semester as possible, as I cannot retroactively provide accommodations after I receive this letter. Please notify me over e-mail by the second week of the term about any known or potential extracurricular conflicts (such as religious observances, graduate or medical school interviews, or team activities). I will try my best to help you with making accommodations, but cannot promise them in all cases. In the event there is no mutually-workable solution, you may be dropped from the class.\nLate work: The precise due dates of both the weekly assignments and of assignments related to the research paper are listed above. For the weekly assignments, one point (out of two) will be automatically deducted for assignments that are turned in up to one day after the due date; assignments will not be accepted after this. Further, I may not be able to provide timely feedback on late assignments. For assignments related to the research paper, assignments turned in late will be penalized one letter grade for every day late (e.g., from an A to a B). If you have a real emergency, contact me at least 24 hours before the assignment deadline.\n\nIf you know now that you will have a conflict with the final exam time (Monday, May 11 from 11:30AM - 2:30PM), either do not take the course or speak with me as soon as possible so that we can work out an accommodation. If you have a truly unforeseen emergency that prevents you from attending the exam, contact me as soon as possible.\n\nGrading policy: If you wish to contest a grade, please e-mail me within one week of receiving the grade and outline in writing (1) the assignment you are contesting, (2) the grade you received on the assignment, and (3) why you believe your grade is unfair. I will consider your appeal and may decide to re-grade your assignment. Please note that a re-grade involves a closer scrutiny of your work and may result in you receiving a lower grade.\nAcademic honesty: UC Berkeley’s honor code states that “as a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” I expect that you will follow this code. Copying the work of others (either your classmates or the work of others you find in books or on the internet) and presenting it as your own is plagiarism. This includes output from Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT). If you are unsure as to whether something constitutes plagiarism, please come talk with me before submitting the assignment! If I find evidence that you have plagiarized work or cheated on an exam, it is grounds to fail you in the course. I take instances of plagiarism or cheating very seriously and trust that it will not be a problem in our course.\n\nTechnology policy: Since much of this course involves data analysis on your computer, you may use a computer during class for class purposes only. Please do not use your cell phone during class. Using your phone or your computer for purposes unrelated to the class will negatively affect your attendance and participation grade.\nGenerative AI: You are encouraged to use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT), Google, and online resources (e.g., StackOverflow or StackExchange) to help you understand statistical concepts, debug code, and clarify new terminology. These tools can provide explanations, suggest libraries or packages, and offer sample code to guide your learning. However, do not copy or paraphrase AI-generated content in any assignment, as this counts as plagiarism. The goal is to use these resources to support your learning and problem-solving in statistics and programming, not to replace your own work. If you are going to spend the time taking this course, you should learn as much as you can."

    "text": "Using a dataset of your choice, choose a research question and construct a plot that helps answer it. Make sure to answer the questions below and that your document renders without errors before submitting.\n\n\nWhat is your research question that you want to answer with this plot? (Remember a research question should end with a “?”)\nIs Berkeley Sociology’s graduate program more appealing to men than women?\n\n\n\nState what you expect to find and why. The justifcation can be based on theory or previous research. Even better (where possible) is to set up competing predictions based on competing theoretical premises: e.g., “If Marx is right, we should find P; but if Weber is right, then we should find Q.\nAlthough the Berkeley Sociology Department is committed to gender balance and despite its reputation as a center for gender research, there seems to be a recent trend toward disproportionately male graduate student cohorts. Based on informal interviews with faculty, I believe that this is not simply a fluke and that Berkeley now disproportionately attracts male students. I therefore predict that men who are admitted to Berkeley will be more likely to accept an offer than women who are admitted.\n\n\n\nDescribe the data in one or two sentences. Then state in one or two sentences why you’re using this data instead of different data.\nI use the count of women and men in the 2010 Berkeley incoming sociology cohort to test this hypothesis. These data come from a list I received from the department in April 2010. Using data from multiple years would allow more accurate estimates but they would apply to a longer period. I use only the most recent year of data in order to assess the current state of the program.\n\n\n\nDescribe the exact procedure you are going to use to analyze the data, including the names of distributions and specific R commands. This can be a short as two or three sentences and no longer than 1/3 of a page in any case.\nIf gender is irrelevant to accepting an offer from Berkeley and equal numbers of both genders are admitted, then a reasonable model of cohort composition is one that follows a binomial distribution with Pr(male) = Pr(female) = .5. I use Stata’s “bitest” function to estimate how probable it is that the observed data were generated by this model. If the model does not fit the data, this would provide evidence that gender does, in fact, play a role in whether or not an admitted student accepts an offer.\n\n\n\nBuild your plot here.

Based on the model above, the probability that this occurred by chance is .039, which is the probability of observing 15 or more male students given 21 independent binomial trials with Pr(male) = .5.

One to three sentences will do.\nMy initial predictions were supported—there are more men than women in the 2010 cohort and this difference does not appear to be the result of chance alone. This suggests that Berkeley sociology may indeed appeal more to men than to women and that any model of the processes that lead to accepting an offer must include gender as a factor.\n\n\n\nThis is where you talk about what you might have done differently or better or what other people should do next time. All research is flawed in dozens of ways, so for this assignment please talk about one limitation of your data, one limitation of your analysis, and one possible alternative explanation for your findings. Three to five sentences is fine.\nThe conclusions we can draw from the data are limited because they come from a single year. Perhaps gender matters this year for some reason but this is not a general trend. The analysis may also be flawed if the assumption that men and women are equally likely to be admitted is inaccurate. Other factors associated with gender might also be the real culprits rather than gender differences in the appeal of the program. Perhaps Berkeley is equally appealing to both genders but women are more likely than men to receive multiple offers from top schools. This would make it less likely that women would accept an offer from any program, not just Berkeley."

Even better (where possible) is to set up competing predictions based on competing theoretical premises: e.g., “If Marx is right, we should find P; but if Weber is right, then we should find Q.\nAlthough the Berkeley Sociology Department is committed to gender balance and despite its reputation as a center for gender research, there seems to be a recent trend toward disproportionately male graduate student cohorts. Based on informal interviews with faculty, I believe that this is not simply a fluke and that Berkeley now disproportionately attracts male students. I therefore predict that men who are admitted to Berkeley will be more likely to accept an offer than women who are admitted."

I use Stata’s “bitest” function to estimate how probable it is that the observed data were generated by this model. If the model does not fit the data, this would provide evidence that gender does, in fact, play a role in whether or not an admitted student accepts an offer."

We also know that the mean is symmetrical. So, among the remaining 5% of observations outside 2 SDs from the mean, 2.5% of observations are over 2 SD below (and below Andre's height), and 2.5% SD are over 2 SD above (and above Andre's height).
