## Course Overview {.smaller}

**Where we've been:**

First, we learned about how to find data from the "real world" and describe it (both graphically and using summary statistics like the mean & variance)

**Where we're going:**

Now, we will turn to what we can **infer** about the "real world", given the data that we have

But first, we'll momentarily take a step back from the actual data to think about the **processes that generated the data**

The models that we will create to understand these processes will allow us to make powerful inferences about the "real world" from the data

## Agenda {.smaller}

**Basics of Probability**

- Probability models
- Sample spaces
- Density curves
- Rules of probability
- Probabilities of multiple events
  - Unions and intersections
  - Conditional probabilities
  - Bayes' theorem

## Randomness and Probability {.smaller}

We will consider a phenomenon to be **random** if individual outcomes are uncertain but there is, nonetheless, a regular distribution of outcomes in a large number of repetitions. Think of there being some level of randomness involved

**Some examples:**

- **Rolling a dice**: all outcomes are equally likely
- **Playing the lottery**: winning is unlikely and rare
- **Taking a standardized test**: not all outcomes are equally likely for a given test-taker, but a test-taker will usually not get the same score every time they take a test

## Randomness and Probability {.smaller}

The **probability** of any outcome of a random phenomenon can be defined as the proportion of times the outcome would occur in a very large number of independent repetitions

- We denote the probability of an event A as **P(A)**
- $P(A) = \frac{\text{number of repetitions where event A occurs}}{\text{total number of repetitions}}$

Repetitions are **independent** if the result of one repetition does not influence the result of other repetitions

## Example: A Coin Toss {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
While the result of any single coin toss is random, the result over many tosses is predictable as long as the tosses are independent

If tosses are independent, then we can say that the probability of tossing "heads" is the proportion of "heads" in a large number of trials

> This illustrates how randomness at the individual level produces predictability at the aggregate level

## Calculating Probabilities {.smaller}

**Empirical approach**

- We can calculate probabilities by observing many trials of a random phenomenon

- The sample proportion of the number of times the outcome occurred is the **probability**

- This is an **estimate** of the actual probability, but a reasonably good one as we observe more and more trials

**Theoretical approach**

- We can also calculate theoretical probabilities based on assumptions about the random phenomena (i.e., all die rolls equally likely)

## Probability Models {.smaller}

**Probability models** are theoretical models that mathematically describe the outcome of random processes. They consist of two parts:

1. **Sample space (S)**: This is a set, or list, of all possible outcomes of a random process. An event is a subset of the sample space

2. **A probability for each possible event** in the sample space S

## Properties of Probability Models {.smaller}

**Three fundamental properties:**

1. **Range**: Probabilities for any given event range from 0 (can't happen) to 1 (happens every time)
   - Formally, for any event A: $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
   - So, the range of probability must be between 0 and 1

2. **Exhaustiveness**: $P(S) = 1$. That is, the sample space is exhaustive of all possibilities
  - In other words, there cannot be any limits on the probability of an occurance

3. **Complement rule**: The probability of an event not occurring is 1 minus the probability that it does occur
   - $P(\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A)$
   - $P(\text{not } A)$ is called the **complement** of A

## Probability Models: Example {.smaller}

**Probability model for a coin toss:**

- **Sample space S**: {Heads, Tails}

- **Probabilities** (assuming a fair coin):
  - $P(\text{Heads}) = 0.5$
  - $P(\text{Tails}) = 0.5$

**Check:** Does this fit the properties?

::: {.fragment}
1. Range: Both probabilities are between 0 and 1 ✓
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. Exhaustiveness: $0.5 + 0.5 = 1$ ✓
:::

::: {.fragment}
3. Complement: $P(\text{not Heads}) = P(\text{Tails}) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$ ✓
:::

## Compound Events {.smaller}

Pretty simple, right? But this becomes more useful when we want to predict **compound events** that are the result of multiple trials

We can figure out the probability of compound events by enumerating all possible outcomes and assigning a probability to each outcome

**Example**: What's the probability of getting two heads in two coin flips?

> We need to consider all possible outcomes and their probabilities


## Example 1: Order matters {.smaller}

A basketball player shoots three free throws. Each shot is either a Hit (H) or Miss (M).

**Sample space** (all possible sequences):

$$S = \{HHH, HHM, HMH, HMM, MHH, MHM, MMH, MMM\}$$

- Total outcomes: **8**
- Reason: Each shot has 2 outcomes → $2^3 = 8$
- 🔑 **Order matters** (HHM ≠ HMH)
  - HHM = Hit, Hit, Miss
  - HMH = Hit, Miss, Hit
  - These are different sequences!


## Example 2: Order doesn't matter {.smaller}

Now we only care about **how many baskets are made**, not the order

**Sample space:**

$$S = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$$

- Each value represents the **number of hits**
- Total outcomes: **4**
- 🔑 **Order doesn't matter**
  - HMH and MHH both → 2 baskets
  - We collapse multiple sequences into single counts

## Example 3: Continuous outcomes {.smaller}

A nutrition researcher feeds a new diet to a lab rat and measures weight gain (grams)

**Sample space:**

$$S = [0, \infty)$$

- Any non-negative real number is possible
- Infinite number of outcomes
- 🔑 **Continuous sample space**
  - Can't list all outcomes individually
  - Must use intervals and density curves

## Comparing Sample Space Types {.smaller}

| Scenario | Type of Sample Space | Order Matters? | Number of Outcomes |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Free throw sequences | Discrete | ✅ Yes | 8 |
| Number of baskets | Discrete | ❌ No | 4 |
| Weight gain | Continuous | ❌ No | Infinite (∞) |

**Key takeaway:** The same physical situation (free throws) can have different sample spaces depending on what question we're asking!

## Discrete Sample Spaces {.smaller}

**Discrete sample spaces** deal with data that can only take on certain values, known in advance (that is, categorical data)

**Example**: Throwing a single die

- $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
- Probability of each event, assuming a fair die: $1/6$

These are straightforward because we can list all possible outcomes

## Continuous Sample Spaces {.smaller}

On the other hand, **continuous sample spaces** contain an infinite number of outcomes. They are typically intervals of possible, continuously distributed outcomes.

**Example**: Picking a random real number between 0 and 1

- $S = [0,1]$ (the interval containing all real numbers between 0 and 1)

**Question**: How do we assign probabilities to outcomes in an infinite sample space?

## Probabilities in Continuous Sample Spaces {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

We use **density curves** to represent probabilities across the continuous sample space, and compute probabilities for intervals as the **area under the curve**

**Example**: Uniform density curve over $S = [0,1]$

Uniform density curves represent when all outcomes in a continuous sample space are equally likely

The shaded portion represents:

$P(0.3 \leq x \leq 0.7) = (0.7 - 0.3) \times 1 = 0.4$

::: {.column width="40%"}

![Uniform density curve with shaded region between 0.3 and 0.7](images/week5/density_curve.png){width="100%,fig-align=\"center\""}

:::
:::::

## Properties of Density Curves {.smaller}

**Three key properties:**

1. **Single point probability**: The probability of a single outcome under a density curve is zero
   - Think: what is the probability that a random number between 0 and 1 is, say, π/4?
   - Only intervals have non-zero probability

2. **Total area**: The total area under a density curve is equal to 1
   - This is the analogue of $P(S) = 1$

3. **Non-negativity**: Density curves are always positive

## Density Curve Examples {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

Density curves come in all shapes and sizes:

- Some are well-known mathematically; others aren't
- Some are described by simple equations; others aren't

**Common types we'll encounter:**

- Uniform distribution (equal probability across range)
- Normal distribution (bell curve)
- Exponential distribution
- And many others...

## Compound Probabilities: Multiple Events! {.smaller}


::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

**Union of events:**

Let A and B be subsets of the sample space S (that is, A and B are events)

The **union** of A and B ("A or B") consists of outcomes that are in A, or in B, or in both A and B

**Notation**: $A \cup B$

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

![](images/week5/union.png){width="40%,fig-align=\"center\""}

:::
:::::


::: aside
In words, whenever you see the $\cup$, it means "the union between". Or put more plainly "everything that’s in A, everything that’s in B, and anything they share."
:::

## Probability of the Union of Two Events {.smaller}


::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Addition rule**: For the union of two events,

$$P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$$

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

![](images/week5/addition.png){width="100%,fig-align=\"center\""}

:::
:::::

**Special case - Disjoint events:**

If the events are **disjoint** (mutually exclusive), then $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0$

Therefore: $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$


## Intersection of Two Events {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}


The **intersection** of A and B ("A and B") consists of outcomes that are in both A and B

**Notation**: $A \cap B$

This represents the overlap between two events

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

![](images/week5/intersection.png){width="100%,fig-align=\"center\""}

:::
:::::


::: aside
In words, whenever you see the $\cap$, it means "the intersection between". Or put more plainly, "only the things that A and B have in common."
:::


## Conditional Probabilities {.smaller}

For events A and B, the **conditional probability** of event A, given that event B has occurred, is:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}$$


**Reading the notation:**

- $P(A|B)$ is read as "the probability of (event) A, given (event) B"
- The vertical slash represents the word "given" or "conditional on"

**Interpretation:**

Of all the times that B occurs, $P(A|B)$ is the proportion of times that A also occurs

## Conditional Probabilities: Connection to Marginal Frequencies {.smaller}

Note that this is equivalent to the **marginal frequency**, which we discussed last week

This shows how probability theory connects to the descriptive statistics we've already learned

![](images/week5/conditional_freq.png){width="100%,fig-align=\"center\""}


## Multiplication Rule {.smaller}

For the intersection of two events:

$$P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$$

Alternatively: $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(B) \times P(A|B)$

It doesn't matter which event we choose first!

## Independent Events {.smaller}

If two events are **independent**, the probability that one event occurs is not affected by whether the other event occurs

**This implies:**

- $P(B|A) = P(B)$
- $P(A|B) = P(A)$
- $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$

**Example**: Coin flips are independent - knowing the first flip doesn't tell you anything about the second flip

## Questions?

## Next Week: Probability Distributions {.smaller}

We will learn about **random variables**, which are numerical measurements of a random phenomenon that take on particular values (or ranges of values) with certain probabilities

- We can represent any variable we've talked about so far in this class—hair color of students, height, income—as a random variable

Then, we'll look at probability models of the distributions of random variables

## Homework {.smaller}

**Assignment details:**

- No data analysis, or even anything in R
- A relatively shorter assignment than last week's
- Rest of class: work on HW in groups

**Groups:**

- Group 1: [**ASSIGN**]
- Group 2: [**ASSIGN**]
- Group 3: [**ASSIGN**]

**Reminder**: <span class="highlight">Research paper proposal is due next Thursday, February 26</span>

Shorter weekly assignment → good opportunity to work on your proposal!

## Research Paper Proposal {.smaller}

**Required components:**

1. **Research question**, asked as a question (1 sentence)

2. **Motivation**: why do we care? (one paragraph)

3. **Hypotheses** about what the answer is, and why (one paragraph)

4. **Data** (1-2 paragraphs):
   - Describe who collected the data, what the units of analysis are (i.e., people, cities, organizations, countries)
   - What year the data is from, how many observations will be in your sample
   - Specifically describe your main independent and dependent variables: what is their level of measurement? If nominal/ordinal, what are the categories? If continuous, what are the units?

## Research Paper Proposal {.smaller}

You don't have to write about what statistical analysis you will use, but you should end with a sentence that talks generally about the relationship you expect to see between your independent and dependent variables

**Example:**

> "I expect that people who report higher family incomes will be more likely to agree with the survey question that the government should reduce taxes."

**Note**: Your proposal can (and prob should) use the data/topic that you've been working with in weekly assignments so far.
