## Agenda {.smaller}

-   Exploring R and Positron
    -   Scripting basics and best practices
    -   [Quarto](https://quarto.org) for submitting hw assignments
-   Types of variables
-   Logical operators
-   Data structures

## Exploring R and Positron {.smaller}

**R and positron are very powerful**

-   Today may seem like a lot if you haven't had much programming experience
-   Please stop me if you are not sure you understand—you are probably not the only one!
-   Helpful if you can follow along in Positron

**Goal of today's lecture:**

-   Basics of using R (through Positron)
-   How to load data
-   How to complete homework

## Positron

-   Open sourced Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
-   Developed by Posit and descendent of R-studio
-   Specifically designed to use R and Python interchangeably
-   Tons of custom extensions - e.g., air, gitlens, quarto, docker
-   Can be used for data science, web apps, websites, books, etc.

Check out [Andres Heiss' blog](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2024/07/08/fun-with-positron/#my-extensions) for more fun things

## Positron

Let's explore Positron live:

-   File explorer
-   Terminal (command line)
-   Interpreter and Folder
-   `New file`
-   `Open`
-   Viewer

## Writing with `script.R`

**Best practice to write all code in a script file**

-   Reproducible code
-   Documents exactly what you have done
-   Allows you to easily correct mistakes

**Two typs of files we'll work with**

-   R file (.R) - only accepts R code
-   Quarto file (.qmd) - allows for R/Python and text

## Writing with `script.R`

**Use a hashtag (`#`)** at the start of lines in your script to tell R not to run that line

-   Useful for making comments about what your code is doing:
-   Helps you remember what you did
-   Helps others (like me, reading your homework) see what you were doing

``` {.r code-line-numbers="3"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# load data
census_data <- read_csv("data/acs2021.csv")
```

## Writing with `script.R`

**Running code:**

-   Windows: highlight the entire line, and hit `Ctrl + r`
-   Mac: cursor on line, hit `command + return`

## Variable assignment in `script.R`

R is an ***object-oriented programming language***, meaning you can create new objects from any type of value, store it R's memory, and call it when necessary

-   Define variables using the assignment operator: `<-`
-   Give variables meaningful names when assigning

``` {.r code-line-numbers="4"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
# load data
acs21 <- read_csv("data/acs2021.csv")
```

## Common values for variables

Values can be:

-   numeric (3, 4.5, `pi`)
-   character ("Welcome!", "foo")
-   boolean (true / false)

``` {.r code-line-numbers="3|4|5"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
numeric_variable <- 4
character_variable <- "Welcome to Soc 106!"
boolean_variable <- TRUE
```

## Variable assignment in `script.R`

Variable names must be unique

-   Reusing an old name will overwrite the definition of the variable

```{r echo=TRUE}
# First assignment
my_variable <- 10
my_variable

# Overwriting the variable
my_variable <- 20
my_variable
```

## Types of variables: numeric

**Numeric variables** can store any real numbers and you can perform standard mathematical operations on numeric variables:

```{r echo=TRUE}
a <- 10
b <- 3

a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
```

## Types of variables: character

**Character variables** can store any text, and are always contained within quotation marks.

```{r echo=TRUE}
first_name <- "John"
last_name <- "Doe"

# Combine character strings
paste(first_name, last_name)
```

## Types of variables: boolean

**Boolean variables** are stored as `TRUE` or `FALSE`, which R stores as 1 or 0

So, in essence, R stores boolean variables as numeric variables

```{r echo=TRUE}
is_enrolled <- TRUE
has_laptop <- FALSE

# R treats TRUE as 1 and FALSE as 0
is_enrolled + has_laptop

sum(is_enrolled, has_laptop)
```

## Converting variable types

Under certain circumstances, we can force R to change the type that it classifies a vector

-   Can always convert numeric → character using the `as.character` function
-   Can convert character → numeric, if the original character vector consists of numbers, using the `as.numeric` function
    -   If it contains characters, then **WE PROB DON'T WANT TO!**

::: aside
If you see a `.` in a function name like `as.numeric`, it is likely base R.
:::

## Converting variable types

Here's what it looks like R:

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Numeric to character
num_var <- 42
char_var <- as.character(num_var)
char_var

# Character to numeric
text_num <- "123"
converted_num <- as.numeric(text_num)
converted_num
```

## Logical operators

-   Use logical operators to compare two variables or objects

-   Useful for manipulating data

| Operator | Meaning                  |
|----------|--------------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                 |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             |
| `<`      | Less than                |
| `>`      | Greater than             |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to |

## Logical operators

Here's what that might look like in R:

```{r echo=TRUE}
x <- 10
y <- 5

x == y
x != y
x > y
x < y
x >= 10
```

## Questions?

## Data structures

Data structures are simply collections of the data objects we have been working with:

-   Numeric
-   Character
-   Boolean variables

While there are many types of data structures in R, we will focus on two for our purposes: the **vector** and the **dataframe**

## Vectors {.smaller}

Vectors are ordered collections of the same type of objects

-   **Ordered**: position matters
-   **Same type**: e.g., can't mix numeric and character

We create vectors using the `c()` operator:

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Numeric vector
ages <- c(22, 25, 19, 30)

# Character vector
names <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana")
```

The `c()` operator works on already-existing vectors as well as variables (if of same type)

## Vectors {.smaller}

We can call individual elements within vectors two ways:

-   using bracket notation: `vector[i]`
-   using the [Tidyverse:](https://tidyverse.org) `nth()`

::: panel-tabset
## Base R

Use bracket at end of vector name with index

The first element of a vector is indexed as 1.

```{r echo=TRUE}
ages <- c(22, 25, 19, 30)

# Get the first element
ages[1]

# Get the third element
ages[3]

# Get multiple elements
ages[c(1, 3)]
```

## Tidyverse

Use `nth()` function to do the same thing more intuitively

Still need Base R to do some things

```{r echo=TRUE}

# load the Tidyverse library
library(tidyverse)

# Get the first element
nth(ages, 1) 

# Get the third element
nth(ages, 3)   

# Still need Base R to get multiple elements
ages[c(1, 3)]
```
:::

## Dataframes {.smaller}

A dataframe is a list of equal-length vectors

-   **Equal length**: same \# elements in each vector
-   But, vectors can be of different types!

We create a dataframe using the `tibble` function:

```{r echo=TRUE}
students <- tibble(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  age = c(22, 25, 19),
  enrolled = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
students
```

::: aside
`stringsAsFactors=FALSE` makes sure that character vectors remain in character type and are not converted to factor type (which we may talk about later in the course).
:::

## Learning about dataframes {.smaller}

-   `glimpse()`: view data and summary info of dataframe
-   `head()`: looks at first few observations (similar to `print()`)
-   `str()`: returns structure of dataframe
-   `colnames()`: returns column names

::: panel-tabset
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

students <- tibble(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  age = c(22, 25, 19),
  enrolled = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

```

### glimpse()

```{r echo=TRUE}

glimpse(students)
```

### head()

```{r echo=TRUE}

head(students)
```

### str()

```{r echo=TRUE}
str(students)

```

### colnames()

```{r echo=TRUE}
colnames(students)

```
:::

## The `Tidyverse`{.smaller}

**What is it?**

-   A collection of R packages designed for data science that share a common philosophy and grammar
-   By far the most common approach to working with R
-   Most intuitive way to do data science

## The `Tidyverse`{.smaller}

**Key Features**

-   **Pipe operator** (`|>` or `%>%`): chains functions together for readable code
-   **Consistent syntax**: functions work similarly across packages
-   **Human-readable**: code reads like sentences

``` {.r code-line-numbers="5|9"}
# |eval=FALSE
# |echo=TRUE

# Base R
mean(subset(dataframe, age > 18)$score)
  
# Tidyverse - "take dataframe, filter where age > 18, 
# then pull score, then calculate mean"
dataframe |> filter(age > 18) |> pull(score) |> mean()
```

## The `Tidyverse`{.smaller}

**Core Packages we'll be using**

-   [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org): for importing data (`read_csv()`)
-   [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org): for manipulating data (`filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, `summarize()`)
-   [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org): for data visualization

## The `Tidyverse`{.smaller}

How the packages work together

``` {.r code-line-numbers="5|8|11|14-18"}
# |eval=FALSE
# |echo=TRUE

# Install (only once)
install.packages("tidyverse") # install library

# Load library
library(tidyverse) # load library

# Load data
data <- read_csv("data.csv") # read in csv

# Process
data |>
  filter(year == 2020) |>  # filter rows based on conditions
  select(name, score)  |>  # select specific columns
  arrange(desc(score)) |>  # order columns
  glimpse()                # glimpse
```

## Keys functions {.smaller}

| Tidyverse Function | Purpose | Example |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| `read_csv()` | Import CSV data | `read_csv("data.csv")` |
| `glimpse()` | Preview dataframe structure | `df |> glimpse()` |
| `colnames()` | Get column names | `colnames(df)` |
| `select()` | Choose columns | `df |> select(name, age)` |
| `filter()` | Choose rows by condition | `df |> filter(age > 20)` |
| `slice()` | Choose rows by position | `slice(df, 1:10)` |
| `arrange()` | Sort rows | `arrange(df, desc(age))` |
| `mutate()` | Create/modify columns | `df |> mutate(age_2x = age * 2)` |

## Key functions in action {.smaller}

```{r echo=TRUE}

# Access a column
students |> colnames() # get column names

# Access specific rows and columns
students %>% 
  slice(1:2) %>%       # select rows
  select(name, age)    # select columns

# Subset based on condition
students %>% 
  filter(age > 20)     # filter rows
```

## Questions?

## File paths and working directories

To load data, R needs to know where to look

-   Need to give it directions
-   The file path: `"file/path/to/data.csv"`

**The Problem**

-   Work on different operating systems or different computers?
-   But what if you move data?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# These break on different computers or operating systems:
read_csv("C:\Users\YourName\Documents\project\data\mydata.csv") # windows
read_csv("~/Desktop/project/data/mydata.csv")                   # mac
```

## The `here` Package {.smaller}

**What is it?** The [`here`](https://here.r-lib.org) package helps you build file paths that work across different computers and operating systems, making your code more reproducible.

**How It Works**

-   `here()` finds your project root (where your project is located)
-   Builds paths relative to that root
-   Works the same on Windows, Mac, and Linux

**The Solution**

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# load library
library(here)

# Check where here thinks your project root is
here()

# Loading data 
data <- read_csv(here("data", "raw", "mydata.csv"))

# Saving results
write_csv(results, here("output", "results.csv"))

```

## Saving and loading data

You can save dataframes as .csv files using the `write_csv()` function:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# save data
#write_csv(object, filepath)
write_csv(results, here("output", "results.csv"))

```

You can also read .csv files into dataframes using the `read_csv` function:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# load data
#read_csv(filepath)
data <- read_csv(here("data", "raw", "mydata.csv"))
```

## Other data types

You can also load Excel files into R

First, load the [`readxl`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org) package:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(readxl)
```

Then, use the `read_excel` function:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# load
data <- read_excel("file_name.xlsx")
```

In fact, R can import all types of data files

Googling "import SAS/STATA/SPSS files into R" will point you in the right direction

## Some helpful R commands

-   `?[function_name]` brings up a help page
-   `??[function_name]` will (sometimes) lead to helpful examples of how to use the function
-   `ls()` lists all objects in the global environment
-   `rm(object_name)` removes an object
-   `rm(list=ls())` removes all objects

## Questions?

## Anatomy of a `.qmd` File

**Three Main Parts**

1.  YAML header
2.  Markdown text
3.  Code chunks

**Key Difference**

-   `script.R`: runs only code
-   `script.qmd`: knits together code and text

## Anatomy of a `.qmd` File

1.  YAML Header (metadata)

Sets document properties, output format, misc. settings

``` yaml
---
title: "My Analysis"
author: "Your Name"
date: "2024-01-07"
format: html  # output format (e.g., pdf, docx, html)
---
```

## Anatomy of a `.qmd` File

2.  Markdown Text (narrative)

Allows you to document code or write explanations, interpretations, and conclusions

``` markdown
# Analysis

This is my larger analysis.

## Method
I can use regular text explaining my analysis. I can also use **bold**, *italics*, and imbed [hyperlinks](https://quarto).Markdown is a simple language to learn how to use.
```

Read more about [markdown basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) you might want to use

## Markdown Basics: Formatting {.smaller}

**Text Formatting**

Here are the most common ways to format text in markdown:

| Markdown Syntax       | Output             |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| `**bold**`            | **bold**           |
| `*italics*`           | *italics*          |
| `***bold italics***`  | ***bold italics*** |
| `superscript^2^`      | superscript^2^     |
| `subscript~2~*`       | subscript~2~       |
| `~~strikethrough~~`   | ~~strikethrough~~  |
| `` `verbatim code` `` | `verbatim code`    |

## Markdown Basics: Headings {.smaller}

You can put headers as well to organize your work. They go up to 6 levels:

**Headings**

| Markdown Syntax | Output |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `# Heading 1` | [Heading 1]{style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold;"} |
| `## Heading 2` | [Heading 2]{style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"} |
| `### Heading 3` | [Heading 3]{style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"} |

## Anatomy of a `.qmd` File

3.  Code Chunks (analysis)

Finally, you can include R code and its output direclty in quarto documents:

```{{{r}}}

# load data
data <- read_csv("data.csv")
summary(data)
```

## Anatomy of a `.qmd` File {.smaller}

So to summarize `.qmd` and `.R` scripts:

| Feature | `.R` Script | `.qmd` Document |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Run code | Create reports |
| **Content** | Code only | Code + text + output |
| **Output** | Console results | Formatted document (e.g., HTML/PDF/Word) |
| **Comments** | `# comment` | Full markdown formatting |
| **Best for** | Data cleaning, functions | Analysis reports, presentations, hw |

## Rendering Quarto Documents {.smaller}

**What is Rendering?**

Rendering (or "knitting") converts your `.qmd` file into a finished document (HTML, PDF, or Word) by:

1.  Running all your R code chunks
2.  Combining code output with your text
3.  Formatting everything into your chosen output format

**How to Render**

-   Click the **"Preview"** button at the top of your .qmd file
-   Render on save so you can see all changes
-   I usually work with it open

## Rendering Quarto Documents {.smaller}

**Output Formats**

For this course, make sure `html` is specified in your YAML header:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Analysis"
format: html        # or pdf, docx
---
```

Can format many different formats (e.g., pdf, docx, odt, epubs, pptx)

## Rendering Quarto Documents {.smaller}

**Source vs Visual Mode**

Positron provides two ways to edit `.qmd` files. Toggle between them using the buttons at the top-left of your editor.

<br>

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Source Mode**

-   Shows raw markdown syntax
-   See the actual code: `**bold**`, `## Heading`
-   More control over formatting
-   Better for experienced users
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Visual Mode**

-   WYSIWYG editor (What You See Is What You Get)
-   Formatting toolbar (like Microsoft Word)
-   Live preview of how text will look
-   Easier for beginners
:::
:::::



## Rendering Quarto Documents {.smaller}

**Which Should You Use?**

-   **Visual Mode**: Great when starting out or writing lots of text
-   **Source Mode**: Better for precise control and learning markdown

> Switch between them! Use Visual for writing, Source for troubleshooting. Just be sure to save when switching in between

## Rendering Quarto Documents {.smaller}

**Tips for making it work**

-   Save your .qmd file before rendering
-   All code must run without errors to render successfully
-   Check the "Render" tab for error messages if rendering fails

**Most common "knitting" errors:**

- Quarto can't execute code 
- Code chunks have the same name 

Should be fine if you don't do anything fancy and don't mess with quarto settings


## Homework #1 {.smaller}

For this week only, I will provide a dataset for you to use on your homework assignment

-   **attain.csv**: data from the General Social Survey
-   in bCourses, Files → Weekly Assignments → HW 1

**Turn in your assignment on bCourses**

-   **HW #1:** due Thursday, February 5, 11:59 PM
-   Turn in **BOTH** `hw1.qmd` and `hw1.html` files
-   Write code and text response intermittenly in file

## In-class lab{.smaller}

Let's setup Positron environment for the course! STEPS: 

1. Download `hw_example.qmd` and `attain.csv` from bCourse
