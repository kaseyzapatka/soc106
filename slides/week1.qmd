## Agenda 

Welcome, and a few remarks about the course

Introductions/Ice Breaker

Discussion of each of today’s learning goals:

- Understand similarities and differences between conventional social science statistics and data science approaches
- Explore the opportunities and risks of “big data” and data science methods/tools for social scientists

## Sociology 106 is…

...an intermediate undergraduate social science research methods course emphasizes the motivation, computation, and interpretation of statistical tests.

**Course Content**

- Statistical tests for one or two continuous or categorical variables
- Interpretation of linear and logistic regression
- Introduction to machine learning framework in the last week
- Data management and analysis using R statistical programming language

**Skills Developed**

Students will gain practical experience in R for conducting statistical analyses and managing data.

## Sociology 106 is not…

...about math. Statistics is about adjudicating between rival explanations of phenomena about a population, using data from that population.

- This course will be taught with more of a focus on the math / statistical theory or with more of a focus on sociological applications

- We will be more applied, still with some math (and some equations)

...about the “one true way to answer sociological questions” *(where quals at?)*.

## For this course, we will assume:

1. Social categories and phenomena can be usefully represented using numbers.
2. Variables measure what they purport to measure.
3. All samples are good samples (unless they are bad samples)


## After completing Sociology 106, you will be able to:

1. Understand the basic logic of statistical inference.
2. Identify the appropriate statistical test given a specific type of data.
3. Compute descriptive statistics, graphs, tables, and simple statistical tests using R.
4. Interpret the results of statistical tests and discuss their relevance to a particular research question.
5. Interpret output from regression and have a basic understanding of the machine learning framework.

## So, what is a statical question?

> In past semesters, has Sociology 106 been more appealing to male or female students?

- One possibility: gender doesn’t make a difference!
- Another possibility: male students are more likely to have taken Sociology 106 in the past


## We could look at some descriptive statistics

Some descriptive statistics…(from a previous semester!)

## The probability model

## One example: 

> In past semesters, has Sociology 106 been more appealing to male or female students?

One possibility: gender doesn’t make a difference!

- <span class="highlight">Null hypothesis: P(student is male) = 50%</span>

Another possibility: male students are more likely to major in Statistics

- Alternative hypothesis: P(student is male) > 50%



## A statistical test

![](images/week1/statistical_test.png){width=100%, fig-align="center"}



## The same test, but in R

```{r echo=TRUE}

binom.test(c(8,3), p = 0.5, alternative="greater")

```

## By the end of this course…

You will be able to test:

- Theories involving one categorical or continuous variable.
  - Ex: gender is often measured as a categorical variable (male / female / other)
  - Ex: income is often measured as a continuous variable (the number of dollars one earns is a real number)
- Theories involving how one (or more) binary or continuous variable affects another binary or continuous variable.

## Required Course Materials

1. Textbook: David Lane’s “Introduction to Statistics”, which is free and you can obtain it [online](onlinestatbook.com/Online_Statistics_Education.pdf)

2. Access to a computer where you can download [R](http://cran.rstudio.com) and [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/download.html) (a free program that makes working in R much easier  and is at the cutting edge of data science right now), as well as data to analyze

3. We’ll start installation of R and RStudio at the end of class--<span class="highlight">this must be done by class next week</span>


## Course Elements

- Attendance and participation (10%)
- Weekly homework assignments  (30%)
- Research paper (40%)
- Final exam (20%)

## Class Format

- First half of class (give or take) will be a lecture where I go over new statistical concepts and show you how to implement these statistical concepts in R

- Second half of class, you will get to practice implementing these concepts in R using data and problems provided by me

## Typical Weekly Assignment 

**Part 1:** 1-3 problems 

Show your work; write out conclusions and interpret results as necessary

**Part 2:** Brief analysis in R and write-up

- Work with your own dataset to apply methods introduced in lecture
- Ideally the same dataset from week to week (you should use the same dataset for your research paper so you can use these analyses in paper)
- For the first assignment, I will provide a dataset on bCourses
- Think carefully about the method, the types of questions it can  answer, and the types of variables that can be used in the method  before choosing variables from your dataset
- Write up using quarto template provided on bCourses and submit to bCourse


## Research Paper

You will develop and present a research question of your choice, address it using statistical techniques from the course that you apply to data in R, and write a paper summarizing your findings

- You can *(and should)* use your weekly assignments to work on your research question

- Several milestones throughout the semester will help you progress towards the final paper


## Keys to Success

Material is cumulative, so it is critical to keep up

- Please ask questions during lecture!
- If you find yourself falling behind, seek help immediately from me during office hours

Learning statistics requires thinking through how to solve problems.

- This is what the weekly assignments are for; you should not expect to fully understand the material until after you have completed the assignment
- Feel free to work on assignments in groups, though what you turn in must be your own work.

## Keys to Success

Learning statistics is like learning a language

- The material in this course can be challenging / counterintuitive if you haven’t seen it before
- It is important not to be intimidated by new terms or the use of letters to represent quantities or variables
- Review your algebra skills if necessary

Lecture slides will be made available, but are not a substitute for careful note taking

## Office Hours

I can help in office hours with questions about concepts from lecture or about coding in R

- **Tuesdays**, right before 11:30 AM-1:00 PM, TBA
- **Tuesdays**, right after class, until 4:30 PM, TBA
    - Sign up at <https://www.wejoinin.com/kaseyzapatka@berkeley.edu>
- If you can’t make either, e-mail me and we’ll find a time

Outside of office hours, your best resources are your fellow classmates!

- If something is really unclear to you and others, e-mail me and we can go over it in next week’s lecture


## Study groups

- I will create your study groups after class, when I should have a better idea of who will remain in the class

- HW #1: due Tuesday, September 4, end of day


## Questions?



## Getting started with R and Positron

Download and install R:[^Rdownload]  
  <https://cran.rstudio.com>


Download and install Positron[^Positrondownload]  
	<https://positron.posit.co/download.html>

[^Rdownload]: Mac users need to check whether they have a Apple Silicon (M1/M2) or Intel processor and download the appropriate version of R for Mac:   
1. Click the Apple menu () in the top-left corner of your screen.  
2. Select **About This Mac**.  
3. Look at the **Processor** or **Chip** line:  
   - If it says **Apple M1**, **M2**, or similar → you have Apple Silicon.  
   - If it says **Intel Core i5**, **i7**, etc. → you have an Intel Mac.

[^Positrondownload]: You can just download the "Universal" option, but know it is slightly larger file and might not be quite as optimized.
